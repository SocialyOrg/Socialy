# Socialy Web API

This is the back-end of Socialy, an alternative social network platform.

Socialy is meant to be a carrier service for other digital services that 
are built during the Covid-19 crisis. The code in this repository contains a
web server that anyone can use to build their own applications.

ðŸ§ª **This API is highly experimental. Things may not work and/or change over time.**

## Overiew

This version of Socialy has been built using [Elixir][1]. Elixir is a
functional programming language that scales incredibly well, and is ideal for
small teams that have a tight deadline. Learning Elixir is not difficult, but 
if you have no experience with functional programming language it will take
some time getting used to.
